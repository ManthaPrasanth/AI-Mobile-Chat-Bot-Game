# 🤖🎮 AI Chat Game Prototype

## 🌟 Overview
This project is a **real-time multiplayer chat game** where humans and AI bots interact inside lobbies.  
It demonstrates:
- ✅ Real-time messaging with **Socket.IO**
- ✅ Lobby management (create/join public or private rooms)
- ✅ Mixed Human + AI chat with **streaming GPT replies**
- ✅ Lightweight game events (e.g., trivia every 5 messages)
- ✅ Mobile-ready **Flutter app packaged as APK**

---

## ✨ Features
- 🔹 **Home Screen** → View all active lobbies with live participant counts  
- 🔹 **Lobby Creation** → Create public/private lobbies with optional passwords  
- 🔹 **Lobby Chat** → Real-time human + AI conversations  
- 🔹 **AI Bot 🤖** → Responds in ~2s, streams reply token-by-token  
- 🔹 **Game Loop 🎮** → Trivia question injected every 5 messages  
- 🔹 **System Events 📢** → Notifications when users join/leave

## 🏗 Architecture
![Architecture Diagram](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3ecde36e-489c-4b79-9cd3-a9dc0c3afc5e)

### 🔄 Workflow
1. **Client (Flutter app)** connects to server via Socket.IO (ngrok tunnel)  
2. **Server (Node.js)** manages lobbies, chat, and event broadcasting  
3. On message → server calls **OpenAI GPT API** for AI reply  
4. AI bot reply is **streamed live** into lobby chat  
5. Every **5th message** → Trivia event injected

## 🚀 Setup & Run Instructions

### 1. Clone Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-chat-game-prototype.git
cd ai-chat-game-prototype
````

### 2. Backend Setup (Node.js)

```bash
cd server
npm install
```

Create `.env` inside `/server/`:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

Start server:

```bash
node server.js
```

✅ Output: `Server running on port 3000`

Expose with ngrok:

```bash
ngrok http 3000
```

👉 Copy HTTPS URL (e.g., `https://46b13e416632.ngrok-free.app`)

### 3. Frontend Setup (Flutter)

```bash
cd client
flutter pub get
```

Update `lib/main.dart`:

```dart
serverUrl: "https://<your-ngrok-url>"
```

Run on emulator:

```bash
flutter run
```

Build APK:

```bash
flutter build apk --release
```

📂 APK Location:
`client/build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk`

### 4. Connect & Test

1. Launch app → Home screen shows lobbies
2. Tap ➕ → Create Lobby (public/private)
3. Inside chat:

   * Send message → 🤖 AI responds in \~2s
   * After 5 messages → 🎮 Trivia event appears
4. Open another device/emulator → test multiplayer

## 📦 Deliverables

* ✅ Signed APK (Android 10+)
* ✅ Source repo (this GitHub)
* ✅ Documentation (README + diagrams in `/docs/`)
* ✅ Demo video (screen recording with voice-over)

---

## ⚠ Known Limitations

* ⚡ Only **1 AI bot per lobby**
* ⚡ AI is **stateless** (no memory across chats)
* ⚡ Server state is **in-memory** (resets on restart)
* ⚡ UI is **minimal** (MVP style)

---

## 🔮 Future Work

* 🔹 Add persistent DB (MongoDB/Postgres)
* 🔹 Support **multiple AI bots** with personalities
* 🔹 Richer gameplay loops (polls, scoring, mini-games)
* 🔹 Add **authentication & persistent profiles**
* 🔹 Improved UI/UX (avatars, themes, animations)
